# kernull
This is a personal playground for tinkering with OS kernel development. It's not meant for production or serious use; it's a space for experimenting, learning, and having fun with low-level code.

Nonetheless...
## Building
For building `kernull` you'll need:
- `nasm` assembler.
- `clang` compiler.
- `lld` linker.
- `make` tool.
- `grub-mkrescue` from the `grub` package.
- An emulator, such as `qemu`.
